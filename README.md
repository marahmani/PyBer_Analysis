# PyBer_Analysis

1.	Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to show the rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services by visualizing the data to make better decisions in forecasting the number of drivers per city type. Throughout the module, we have used different types of charts to understand it better and make better conclusions. We have calculated total number of rides, average fares for each city type and total number of drivers for each city type and used different charts to show them visually.
2.	Results:

Ridesharing Data by City Type

Urban shows overall that it has bigger total rides and drivers and total fares among the other two cities. It also has the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

Sum of Total Fares Each Week

Urban city again shows higher total fare in comparison to Suburban and Rural cities considering the weekly combined data sorted.

Total Fares by City Type

In this graph we can see the total fare by each city based on the collected data. The x_axis represent the Months, the y-axis represents the Fare in $USD.

3.	Summary:
By comparing the average number of rides between each city type, we realize that the average number of rides in the rural cities is 3.5 and this shows it is 2.5 times lower than Urban and Suburban cities.
There is one outlier in the urban ride count data. Also, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively. The average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities.
The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
It is best that the CEO eliminated the number of drivers in Urban city and increase the number of drivers in rural city. This will help the total fare to increase and the will reduce the driversâ€™ costs respectively.
